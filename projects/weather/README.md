### Local Weather App

__February 10, 2018__

Let's be honest, the outdoors is a scary, unforgiving place. If you're like me, you want to know what it's like out there without having to risk a lightning strike, heat stroke, or social interaction. That's why I built this Weather App. It calls upon the OpenWeatherMap API to tell you about that horrible place we call 'outside'.

__NOTE:__ The API is routed through freeCodeCamp.org to avoid authentication, and can sometimes return incorrect data. A couple 'refreshes' usually does the trick.


__Languages:__ HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

__Additional:__ JSON APIs, Bootstrap 4, Haml, SCSS, and JQuery

__Concepts:__ HTML5 Geolocation, and Data Management
