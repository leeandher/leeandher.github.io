### Simon Game

__March 15, 2018__

Back in 1978, Milton Bradley distributed this electronic memory game to distract children and give their parents some breathing room. This faithful re-creation of said game, has all the fun features of the original plus my own spin on things (the joke is that one of my features is spin-mode). Turning on your sound helps quite a bit, and if you manage to get to 20, congratulations! Send me a link to a screenshot and I'll comment your name into the source code.
