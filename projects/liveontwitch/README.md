### Twitch.tv Stream Client

__February 15, 2018__

Videogame livestreaming is the new hotness. If you want to stay up-to-date with all your favourite streamers, this Twitch.tv client I developed is going to be your best friend. It grabs a bunch of useful information about the streamer's current status (from the Twitch.tv API) and puts it all in one convenient dashboard. Dynamically Add, sort, and filter to your heart's content. GLHF!
