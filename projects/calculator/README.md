### JavaScript Calculator

__March 06, 2018__

This web app is the one-stop shop for quick maths. This full-page calculator app runs entirely on my hand-coded JavaScript. It performs linear operations (no PEDMAS) hyper fast and supports numpad/keystroke input as well. It's even responsive on mobile, so you can finally ditch that pocket calculator you lug around everywhere. Why did you have that in the first place?
