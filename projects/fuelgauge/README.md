### Tic-Tac-Toe

__March 21, 2018__

It's time to grab a pal and showdown in the greatest strategy game of 1300 BCE. If you don't have a partner, I've got you covered: AI. This implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe (Naughts and Crosses, if you prefer) allows for both Player vs. Player and Player vs. AI. My AI even has difficulty settings, for you to hone your TTT Skills, however, avoid the 'Impossible' difficulty, unless you want TacTic Bot to show you how Terminator should have ended.
