### Preface

At the end of every month, I will be updating this journal with some info about my progression through learning to program.
This will include stuff like what resources I'm using, what I've accomplished, links to projects, side-projects, ideas and ambitions for the future.
I'm still going to have to complete my University courses, some Work Term Reports and work on my Engineering Degree, but this is going to my major side quest in life.
<br><br>
I'm going to try to dedicate as much time as I can manage to keeping this mission going, but I have a long road ahead of me.
If everything goes according to plan, I should have a nice little summary for every month to document journey to maybe getting a career in software development!
