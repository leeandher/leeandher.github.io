### leeandher.github.io

Welcome to my GitHub pages repo. I use it to redirect to my website and you can check out all of that source code over at https://github.com/leeandher/personal-site. Here, I host all of the files that I used while working on projects, as well as Markdown Versions of the blog posts that I publish to my actual website.

I might consider changing up my GitHub repo organization strategy in the future, but for now I find that this is a clean solution to make viewing source code and raw text easier than going through the `personal-site` repository.
